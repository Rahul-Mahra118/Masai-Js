        <h2>Kedarnath: The Lord of the Field </h2>
        <p>With its feet touching the beautiful village of Sankri, about 10 hours away from Dehradun, Kedarkantha sits strongly at a height of 12,500 feet.

            Kedarkantha means Throat of Lord Shiva. Other than Kedarkantha, following are the major Shiva temples: Kalpeshwar: Hair of Lord Shiva, Rudranath: Face of Lord Shiva, Tungnath: Arms of lord Shiva, Madhyamaheshwar: Navel of Lord Shiva, Kedarnath: Back of Lord Shiva, Pashupati, Nepal.
            
            The myth goes back to the time of Mahabharata. After the war the Pandavas went to himalayas to seek blessings from Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva did not appear to meet them. Instead he took a disguise of buffalo and mislead the Pandavas. Bheem seeing the herd of buffalo played a trick. He stood on two rocks with his legs opened wide. The buffalo were made to pass under Bheem. One of the buffalo (disguised) refused to pass resulting in fight with Bheem. In this fight, Bheem ripped apart the buffalo in pieces. The place where these pieces fell Pandavas later constructed temples of Shiva to worship.</p>
