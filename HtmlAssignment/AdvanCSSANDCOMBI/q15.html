<!-- Create a navigation bar with three main sections, each containing multiple links.
Use descendant combinators to style links within each section differently, applying distinct colors to links in different sections.
Apply :hover and :active pseudo-classes to style each link dynamically when hovered or clicked.
Use a child combinator to style only the direct child links within each section differently than nested links.
Ensure that links with an href starting with https have a specific color that overrides all other link styles using specificity. -->
